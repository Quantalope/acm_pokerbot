# PokerBot

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üèÜ How the Tournament Will Proceed (IMPORTANT)

1. For the first hour, we will be building bots in teams of 2 or 3. (Find instructions below.)
2. In the second hour, you will run your bot and compete with other bots. By this point, make sure your team is registered
    and has a unique ID for your seat at the table. 

## The tournament will proceed in a knockout format

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 1st Round
In Blocks of 4 minutes (3 tables total)

1st Block: 9/9/9 bots

2nd Block: 8/8/8 bots

...

6th Block 3/3/3 bots

First 24 minutes: bots will be evenly divided into 3 tables. The bot with the lowest stack will be kicked out every 4 minutes.
  In total, 6 bots will be kicked in this round. The top 3 will then proceed to the next round.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ 2nd Round
In Blocks of 4 minutes (1 table total)

1st Block: 9 bots

2nd Block: 8 bots

9th Block: 1 bot remaining 

Next 25 minutes: the top 3 bots from all 3 tables will compete on a single table against each other.
    The bot with the lowest stack will be kicked out every 4 minutes. The top bot remaining will win!

### ‚ùóÔ∏è At any point if a bot takes more than 10 seconds to make a move, they will be kicked out.

Prizes TBA!

## ü§ñ How to Build Your Own Strategy

1. Clone the Poker Table system here and set it up (instructions provided on that repo).
2. Clone this repository.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd pokerbot
```

3. Run an example bot using the strategy provided (`example_strat_1.py`). All you have to do for this have 
   two or more team members run `main.py` and connect to server provided (edit server and port details in a ``.env`` file).
   (Or you can run multiple bots in different terminals.)
4. Once you understand how the game proceeds, look at `example_strat_2.py` for a very bare bones approach of how you can
    think about making a Poker bot that thinks algorithmically. Change line 21 in ``main.py`` to use ``example_strat_2`` instead.
5. Once you understand this, you can proceed to ``example_strat_3.py`` which is a little more complicated but nothing too crazy.
6. If you have any questions, reach out to any organizing members walking around. Good luck!
